Could you change the conflict in the room?
The collison in the room is now "Simple Collison".
If we use this, the navigation mesh and 
plug-in you use will be unusable and AI will not move.
Therefore, I want you to discard the current collision and change
 "Collison Complexity" to "Use Complex Collison As Simple".
